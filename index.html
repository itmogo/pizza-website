           <h3> Pizza is awesome</h3>
          <p> The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.
            A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were 
            then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.            
            The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy.
            Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy
            came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>

            <p>Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies 
              eaten by Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some also trace its origins to other Italian paschal 
              breads. Abba Eban writes "some scholars think [pizza] was first made more than 2000 years ago when Roman soldiers added cheese and 
              olive oil to matzah".better source needed] Other examples of flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world 
              are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans); Manakish in Levant, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from
              Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna 
              in Italy.</p>

              <p>Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or 
                disk-like shape); the Indian paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and South Asian naan (leavened) and roti (unleavened); 
                the Sardinian carasau, spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that throughout Europe there are many similar
                pies based on the idea of covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as the Alsatian flammkuchen.</p>

            <h3>Pepperoni Pizza</h3>
            <p> Pepperoni is an American variety of salami,
               made from a cured mixture of pork and beef 
               seasoned with paprika or other chili pepper.
              Pepperoni is characteristically soft,
              slightly smoky, and bright red in color.
              Thinly sliced pepperoni is a popular
              pizza topping in American pizzerias.  </p>
